# ELU
Exponential Linear Unit or its widely known name ELU is a function that tend to converge cost to zero faster and produce more accurate results. Different to other activation functions, ELU has a extra alpha constant which should be positive number.
## Function
$$
   F(x) = x,\quad x  > 0
$$
$$
	= \alpha( e^{x} - 1),\quad  x\leq0
$$
